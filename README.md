## PICOEMU

This is the repository for an implementation of a PICO-8 Emulator!

PICO-8 is a Fantasy Console created by [Zep](https://twitter.com/lexaloffle). You should [DEFINITELY check it out](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) before using this. PICOEMU in no way, shape or form replaces this wonderful little console, it's super awesome to use and it has a [great community](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?cat=7).
 
This emulator keeps the memory layout but without the CPU and memory limits so that we can expand on PICO-8 games as much as we want to. It is also possible to export games made with PICO-8 to other platforms such as Xbox, PS4 and Switch (given that you have the proper SDK for it).

If you find a bug, want something to change or would like to add a feature, you can create a bug of send me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MatheusMortatti)! Feel free to create pull requests after the bug or feature is discussed!
